# Template_LaTex
This repository contains various samples of LaTeX codes and samples made for LaTeX and in LaTeX. All documents given here were compiled using TeXLive with XeLaTeX.

# Article Template
The main template on which I am currently working. More details will arrive "soon" (as soon as I can).

# LaTeX technical notes
Code samples used in the different templates (or not) that may prove useful. 

# Document template
An article style document templating that provides several title pages and an automatic configuration via a conf file. Not completed, but forked and reused for the actual "Article Template".

# Two columns template
A second version of the document template, but this time adapted to create documents with a main column and a side columns for notes. This intents to highlight side notes and remarks if those one are numerous and important to understand the content of the document.

# Beamer template
A custom template to create Beamer presentation. This one is inspired by Palo Alto, though colors are less present and some styles and elements vary.
